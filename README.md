Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods,and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.It involves design, development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software products.

Software engineering plays a crucial role in the tech industry bt enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication,healthcare and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering 1968
the term software engineering was first introduced in 1969,it was coined to address the software crisis where software systems were becoming complex leading to project failures.
The Rise of Structured Programming 1970-1980
The adoption of structured programming helped reduce complexity and improve maintainability. Programmes like C,Pascal
The Emergence of Agile Methodologies 2000s
Agile Manifesto was introduced ,shifting the focus from rigid development processes to flexibility,collaboration, and iterative development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement.
Design-creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Iplementation-writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing-COnducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standard and functional requirements.
Deployment-releasing the software to the users.
Maintance-Providing ongoing support ,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Flexibility- Waterfall model is rigid ;difficult to change once the project starts e.g Hospital patient records.
             Agile model is more flexible allows changes throughout the development process e.g Market trends
Testing- Waterfall model testing is done at the end of development cycle e.g
         Agile model continous testing throught the project e.g continous feedback

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-Responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance-Ensures quality by designing and executinmg test plans.
Project Manager-Oversees the planning execution and deliveryof software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are important software suites that provide copmrehensive tools for writing, for debugging and testing code .eg. Visual studio
VCSthese are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements-Requirements may change during development cycle,leading to project delays.
Tight deadlines-Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in compromised quality.
Strategies to overcome the challenges
Priotization of tasks.
Regular reassessment of project goal and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Testing individual components or modules of software.
intergration-Testing interaction between different components or subsystems.
Acceptance-Testing the software against user requirement to ensure meets user needs.
Importance  of quality assurance
Quality measures such as code reviews and automated testing and continous intergration help identify and fix defects earlyin the development process, leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about tribal war in kenya .
Tell me about the 2007 ielection violence and how tribal background impacted on it.
the improved prompt will enable to get a more focused and detailed response.
